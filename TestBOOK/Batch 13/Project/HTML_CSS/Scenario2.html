            <p><b>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically.<br> Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.<br> These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.<br> A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. <br>This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.<br>

                A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems.<br> Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.<br> Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.<br>
                
                Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. <br>Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. <br>Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms.<br> More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.<br> The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. <br>

            <p><b>A smartwatch is a wearable computing device that closely resembles a wristwatch or other time-keeping device.

                In addition to telling time, many smartwatches are Bluetooth-capable. The watch becomes a wireless Bluetooth adaptor capable of extending the capabilities of the wearer's smartphone to the watch. The wearer can use the watch's interface to initiate and answer phone calls from their mobile phone, read email and text messages, get weather reports, listen to music, dictate email and text messages, and ask a digital assistant a question.
